Here's some stuff that you can't read at all, but what does it say?  Who knows?  Oh well, so then I told her...  Oh wait, hello there!

Alright, so what is this thing?  Some kind of scam to take a bunch of fantastic ideas and make a jillion dollars stealing them?  Well, yes.  Oh wait, no!  I meant no.  :)

Ok, so basically, I'm just your typical iPhone developer who really thinks it's fun making iPhone apps.  I'm not planning on making money with this, this is a bit of an experiment, you see.  It's one part challenge for myself, to see what I can do in terms of engineering, and also a kind of an art project.  I'm coming into this with no preconceived ideas about what this app will eventually be.  Send me your ideas and every week I will add at least one new feature.  As it grows and takes on more definition, then I'll hold elections and contests to help focus where things are headed.  For now, though, just give me one simple thought.  It doesn't have to be complex, just a simple idea, and I'll do my best to add it, and will recognize your contribution in the credits.
